# Parcel JS boilerplate

a boilerplate for using `Parcel JS` for front-end development!
Inspired and cloned from https://github.com/jh3y/parcel-boilerplate.git by jhey tompkins

* Markup compilation
* Stylesheet compilation
* Script compilation
* Source linting
* Static server with automatic live reload/style injection

Gets you up and running with `Parcel JS` quickly! 🏃

Currently the boilerplate makes use of `pug`, `stylus` and `es6/babel`. But these could easily be swapped out/removed based on your requirements.

The idea is that _you_ will fork your own version and adapt it to fit your requirements 👍

## Usage

As a prerequisite it's assumed you have `npm/yarn` installed and the `gulp-cli`.

1. Clone the originmal repo

        git clone https://github.com/jh3y/parcel-boilerplate.git

2. Install dependencies

        npm install / yarn

3. Start

        make develop

## Tasks
The boilerplate makes uses of a self-documented `Makefile`. You can see all available tasks with `make` 😎
